# CreditCapital Contracts

*Updated 21/26/21*
Currently the contracts in the Deploy 1 folder are active in production on Polygon. The addLiquidity2.sol contract in Deploy 2 is intended to replace addLiquidity.sol as a way to resolve a slippage bug which results in the user losing tokens to the contract.
